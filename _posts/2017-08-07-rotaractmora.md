The lovely memories at Rotaract Mora cannot be summarized to a single sheet, or a couple of paragraphs, when it truly comprises of a number of chapters in my Book of Life… 

When I look back and connect the dots it truly has been an awesome period in my life, thus the feel of importance to summarize the memories, knowledge and the experiences gathered. 

#Make Dreams Real…

The three-year journey commenced with the involvement in numerous projects as a team player and as a project chairperson. It was certainly a learning curve as a fresh undergraduate working under the senior Rotaractor’s and obtaining the guidance and mentoring which was key towards the successful journey. I was fortunate to work with some of the greatest inspirational Leaders and Mentors of Rotaract Mora to shape up my personality and working with them highlighted the significant qualities that they possessed. 

#Hope Rekindled, Gladdening Hearts…

Setting aside the seriousness, it was always the friends, the fun at Rotaract which led to awesome memories. We worked together as a team in numerous projects ranging from different avenues. And always it was fun being with the guys, and to be honest it was never tiring or hard. Yes, some of the projects were hard challenging but No we were never tired. The friendship the passion made us thrive and led to the fun heart warming memories which would be cherished for a lifetime. 

We had our strengths and weaknesses but as a team we were able achieve the un-thought and the undone. I had experience being a part and leading teams, but a team of volunteers was an entirely new experience, motivating the fellow mates to achieve together. It was never about an individual, it was always about the Rotaract Mora Family and networking. The friends and family I made are the greatest wealth, happiness which I take away from Rotaract Mora along with the sweet memories. Working together made us closer, created undying bonds and as a result I have a set of friends who are there to take care of each other. Those set of crazy friends can always bring a smile and make you forget of all the troubles you have. Even a minute spent with them will bring forth loads of laughter and will lead to the craziest of tales….

We did a massive number of projects together. But to me the Legendary Crew of RuR15 was the best!!! You guys were simply amazing. With such a team nothing is unachievable. Thanks guys for all the support and the fun. Together we have created and been part of the unblemished legacy of Rotaract Mora. 

Rotaract Mora taught me a lot through the experiences. We made mistakes, we corrected them. And sometimes I made the same mistake twice just to be sure that it was indeed a mistake. But,

 “only time makes you understand that sometimes your mistakes lead you to the most beautiful and the happiest memories in life”. 

#Letting Them Shine…

We focused on the future as well as the present, tried new things and we were successful, and a lot more of the formed ideas and plans would realize in future. Where the ultimate goal and focus was towards ensuring the legacy of Rotaract Mora not on individual legends. 

Guiding the young Rotaractor’s, I understood that it is important to believe in people. I always believe in the person, his ability. Sometimes you need to take a risk, give a second chance so that they could prove themselves. There was a point within the Rotaract journey where we had to impart our gained knowledge and inspire, motivate the youngsters, and I’m really happy to see them thriving with success and that the risks and chances that I have took have certainly paid of and that the future of Rotaract Mora lies in very capable hands.   

Awards, we were never less of them and it wasn’t our main focus either. We have achieved a lot and its hard to keep track of them… But for me it was never the piece of paper or metal which mattered. The only thing I take away today are the happy priceless memories not the awards. The personal satisfaction I gained through projects, the happy adventures my friends gave me and the happiness we generated in others through our projects are much more valuable to me. 

So my final advice to the fresh blood of Rotaract Mora, it’s the self satisfaction, friends, memories and the chance of bringing positive change and happiness to the people which should drive you towards the goals and nothing else. Focus on those would assure you of an awesome Rotaract journey and in the end it would make you really hard say good bye…

All the very best for the future of Rotaract Mora.
