Peter Thiel is a popular figure when it comes to Startups. He started is startup journey Co Founding PayPal which was eventually sold to eBay. Afterwards he has founded a number of companies including Palantir Technologies, a big data company. He was the first outside investor for Facebook. This book Zero to One is based on the course he conducted on startups at Stanford University which contains the notes taken by Blake Masters.

The book covers some important aspects which should be addressed by startups when they pursue their venture, along with important details to build your future. The book contains many illustrations and presents concepts really simply, which enables anyone to quickly grasp and understand. I would like to summarize key concepts presented, and hope that it would inspire you to read this valuable book.

The book starts off with an important question,

 ## “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”

This is the basis where the argument of working on novel ideas is highlighted in contrast to working on the same stuff carried out in the past. Thiel identifies that copying things that already work, only enables horizontal or extensive progress. He identifies this as going from 1 to n. Where there will be small incremental changes. The alternate is to focus on vertical or intensive progress where  you work on doing new things, inventing new technologies, which is the only way we can go from 0 to 1. The idea is illustrated in the following diagram extracted from the book. 

The book identifies concepts where it is better to risk boldness than triviality and how even a bad plan is better than having no plan when you start working. Also it highlights the importance of sales as much as the product which is often neglected. Both the Sales and the product should both be focussed on to achieve success. 

Competitive markets destroys the potential profits.  The book dives into identifying important facts about successful companies which focus on avoiding these issues. All happy companies are different, and because of that they are able to achieve a Monopoly Status. This is a concept which is highlighted where startups are urged to focus on differentiating themselves in the market that they operate. It also identifies the importance of clearly identifying this differentiating factor as sometimes we may well be trapped inside an illusion where our product is not so different than we think it is.

The examples how Amazon started off differentiating themselves in the niche market of selling books online initially, and how they eventually started to grow is presented in relation to these ideas of building a Monopoly. It also identifies the notion that the companies which already possess the Monopoly Status would lie to keep their monopoly status avoiding possible regulation. In contrast to companies in Perfect Competition, which would always try to lie or present themselves as different and unique among others.

The characteristics of a Monopoly are also identified as follows,
* Proprietary Technology
* Network Effect
* Economies of Scale
* Branding

First Mover Vs Last Mover
These concepts are discussed where the first mover is identified not as a goal to achieve but rather as a tactic and that the last mover or the company who moved into the particular market last would make the largest great development and thus enjoy profits. 

Many important concepts are discussed such as the Power Law and how venture capitalists uses it to build portfolios and the Founders Paradox, where founders traits are analyzed to identify what is required to build a great company. I do not wish to explain them in detail in this summary and strongly urge you to read the book and understand these concepts.

Sales concepts on how to sell a product are also identified for various types of target consumers and different types of marketing methods for each target segments. Finally I would like to present an interesting set of questions presented in the book, which encompass the entire spectrum of what we should answer when we are starting a company. 

Seven Questions Every Company Must Answer,
* The Engineering Question - Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
* The Timing Question - Is now the right time to start your particular business?
* The Monopoly Question - Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
* The People Question - Do you have the right team?
* The Distribution Question - Do you have a way to not just create but deliver your product?
* The Durability Question - Will your market position be defensible 10 & 20 years into the future?
* The Secret Question - Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?

I hope this small summary helped you in understanding the importance of the concepts presented in 0 to 1, to prompt you towards reading and gathering knowledge for a successful startup.
