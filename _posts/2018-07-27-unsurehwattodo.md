Decisions. Decisions are tough to make when there are lot at stake. It might be about your career, which job to accept?, which stream to pursue your studies or another important life decision. You may be presented with numerous paths, with different levels of risk, benefits and opportunities, where you need to decide with the limited information you possess about the dynamic unpredictable future. Yes, its hard. 

With age your responsibility grows and there will be many who will be affected by your decisions. Hence making in tougher to decide on what to do, and what you really want. Go back a few years when you were just a child. Comparatively then you were also presented with similar questions, which you had an answer ready, and it was really easy.

If someone asked who you are going to become when you are big, “I want to be a Pilot, I want to be a Doctor”, the answers will be instantaneous. Decision making wasn’t hard at all. And when one asks the younger version of you why you choose that profession, you will readily have another answer. “I want to help the sick, I like to fly.” With time our life has become more complex and with more responsibility and various influences, we have forgotten the core forces inside which defines us. You have become a different personality. 

How can you become yourself again ? How are you going to find what you really want in life and take the correct decision? 

The answer is simple. Remember how your first essay when you were small was about “myself”, that essay I believe was a genuine document representing what you really loved and expressing who you really are and what you really want. If you know what you really want, no decision will be hard, and whatever paths you are presented, you would be able to choose the best path for you. 

With time you have lost the ability of correctly understanding yourself mainly due to your ignorance. Once you are presented with questions, decisions you are ignorant enough to analyze what you are really looking for. You keep contemplating, analyzing all the decisions you are presented with and try hard to make a decision. And most of the times the reason why its hard to take the decision is the fact that you really don’t know what you really want!!!

So how can I know what I really want ?

Its really simple. Just write a small essay on “myself”. Relax and just scribble like a young boy or girl. “My name is Chirath, and I’m 24 years old, I love to read & write, I want to ….” All the answers you were looking for will be in that small document. You don’t have to rack your brains for answers, just do this small exercise during your leisure time. 

Once you understand what you really want, it would be clear which decision to make. And the most important thing is when we were small we were not afraid of failure and so we pursued our dreams and what we loved to do. And it should be the same even if you are an adult, just do what you love and focus on your dreams. It’s ok to fail on a decision you took which reflected what you really wanted, compared to regretting the decisions you never took and being frustrated about the decisions you take.

Just be your self, be genuine and think like when you were child. Each and everyone is different in their own ways. You will be able to understand who you really are and what you really want. Don’t make the mistake of living someone else's life!!!

In conclusion, the method is really simple keep a small piece of paper or a note on your laptop, an essay of “myself”. When you are presented with tough decisions, you might forget who you really are, what you really want. If so just go back and read the essay “myself” and you will have the answers in no time. 

I wish you all the very best in all the tough decisions you have to make and you are yet to make.
