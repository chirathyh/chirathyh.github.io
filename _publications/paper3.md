title: "A Wearable System to Analyze the Human Arm for Predicting Injuries Due to Throwing"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2019-04-01-embc
excerpt: 'There is limited understanding on factors that contribute to throwing related injuries that frequently occur in sports such as Baseball, Cricket and Javelin throwing.
This preliminary study focuses on the development of a real time wearable system focusing on extracting key parameters related to potential upper arm injuries associated with the throwing action in the game of Cricket. A wearable system is developed to analyze Electromyography (EMG) signals for detecting muscle activity and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for monitoring the arm motion.
The extracted parameters are then used for analysis, focusing on detecting established indicators of potential injuries. Additionally, an unsupervised learning algorithm is developed towards identifying novel relationships indicating potential injuries.'
