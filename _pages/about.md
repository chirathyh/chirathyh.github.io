Hi I'm Chirath, a third year PhD student at the School of Computing, Australian National University. Following my passion in Machine learning (ML) & Health Informatics, currently I’m part of the Big Data program of the “Our Health In Our Hands (OHIOH)” ANU Grand Challenge initiative. My research focuses on designing a control system to the artificial pancreas for glucose regulation in Type 1 Diabetes. I enjoy exploring the research areas of ML, reinforcement learning and control systems.

<!-- I completed my BSc (Hons) in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and a product of Ananda College, Colombo 10. I have diverse interest areas in research such as AI, Machine Learning, Biomedical Signal Processing, Financial Analytics and Data Science. I'm a CIMA passed finalist, and have been able to successfully combine my engineering and accounting knowledge to work on develop algorithms focusing on financial predictions and fraud analytics. 

I believe that there is great potential to apply AI towards healthcare which undoubtedly will add great value. My passion in this domain lead towards working on projects related to Biomedical Engineering and Machine Learning. I have worked on disease prediction applications focusing on the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals of users and injury prediction applications using Electromyography (EMG) signals and IMU data. Detailed descriptions and findings of the projects can be accessed through the Portfolio section.  -->

<!-- My philosophy is to keep everything simple, and I love to read, write and play the guitar, Chess during my leisure time. My thoughts are expressed in the form of a Blog which can be accessed through the Thoughts section. My passion is to work on novel research areas, where my ultimate goal is to combine my Engineering & Entrepreneurial skills to ensure great value addition to the society. -->
