**Hi! I'm Chirath.** 

I'm interested in exploring Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning algorithms for decision-making in medical applications, with a focus on developing closed-loop clinical treatment solutions. This is often challenging due to the complex dynamics, partial observability, high inter- and intra-population variability, safety & practical learning constraints, and the presence of unknown delays and disturbances. These complexities call for the development of real-world algorithms capable of handling safety and explainability requirements, which are vital in medical applications. Current research directions:
1. Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) to Automate Treatment in Type 1 Diabetes.
2. Developing Algorithms for a New Therapeutic for Depression Using Closed-Loop Non-invasive Brain Stimulation.

<!-- My PhD research focused on designing a control system using reinforcement learning to an artificial pancreas system for glucose regulation in Type 1 Diabetes. If you are interested in collaborations, to learn more about my research, or in sharing your research work please contact me. -->

**1.Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based Artificial Pancreas Systems (APS) to Automate Treatment in Type 1 Diabetes.**

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) requires the administration of insulin externally to maintain glucose levels, which is cruicial as both low and high glucose levels are detrimental. This is usually done through an insulin pump attached to the body. An continuous glucose sensor is also attached to measure the glucose levels so that a control algorithm can estimate the appropriate insulin dose. I design RL algorithms for this control problem. The figure below represents the main components of an Artificial Pancreas System (APS) to treat T1D.

Maintaining glucose levels is a life-long optimisation problem, complicated due to the disturbances associated with daily events (meals, exercise, stress.. etc), delays present in glucose sensing and insulin action, partial observability, and safety constraints among others. Below you can see a simulated glucose control strategy of a RL algorithm.

Previously, I completed my PhD (Computer Science) at ANU and I was part of the Big Data program of the “Our Health In Our Hands (OHIOH)” ANU Grand Challenge initiative. I completed my BSc (Hons) in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and MSc (Research) in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka and also a CIMA passed finalist. I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer in the FinTech industry, developing algorithms for identifying outliers in corporate financial transactions, forecasting, name screening and risk prediction applications. During the final year of my undergraduate studies, I pursued my entrepreneurial aspirations by co-founding a healthcare startup where we designed [Clardia](https://chirathyh.github.io/portfolio/j-clardia/) which achieved multiple awards and publications.

<!-- I completed my BSc (Hons) in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and a product of Ananda College, Colombo 10. I have diverse interest areas in research such as AI, Machine Learning, Biomedical Signal Processing, Financial Analytics and Data Science. I'm a CIMA passed finalist, and have been able to successfully combine my engineering and accounting knowledge to work on develop algorithms focusing on financial predictions and fraud analytics. 

I believe that there is great potential to apply AI towards healthcare which undoubtedly will add great value. My passion in this domain lead towards working on projects related to Biomedical Engineering and Machine Learning. I have worked on disease prediction applications focusing on the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals of users and injury prediction applications using Electromyography (EMG) signals and IMU data. Detailed descriptions and findings of the projects can be accessed through the Portfolio section.  -->

<!-- My philosophy is to keep everything simple, and I love to read, write and play the guitar, Chess during my leisure time. My thoughts are expressed in the form of a Blog which can be accessed through the Thoughts section. My passion is to work on novel research areas, where my ultimate goal is to combine my Engineering & Entrepreneurial skills to ensure great value addition to the society. -->
