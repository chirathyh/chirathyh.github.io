**Hello... I'm Chirath,** 

A PhD student at the School of Computing, Australian National University. I’m part of the Big Data program of the “Our Health In Our Hands (OHIOH)” ANU Grand Challenge initiative. 

I completed my BSc (Hons) in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering and MSc (Research) in Computer Science & Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka and also a CIMA passed finalist. I have worked as a Machine Learning Engineer in the FinTech industry, developing algorithms for identifying outliers in corporate financial transactions, forecasting, name screening and risk prediction applications. During the final year of my undergraduate studies, I pursued my entrepreneurial aspirations by co-founding a healthcare startup where we designed [Clardia](https://chirathyh.github.io/portfolio/j-clardia/) which achieved multiple awards and publications.

I enjoy exploring the research areas of Reinforcement Learning, Health Informatics, ML, DL, Control Systems and Biomedical Signal Processing.

My current research focus is mainly on designing a control system using reinforcement learning to an artificial pancreas system for glucose regulation in Type 1 Diabetes. If you are interested in collaborations, to learn more about my research, or in sharing your research work please contact me. 

**My research at a glance...**

Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) requires the administration of insulin externally to maintain glucose levels, which is cruicial as both low and high glucose levels are detrimental. This is usually done through an insulin pump attached to the body. An continuous glucose sensor is also attached to measure the glucose levels so that a control algorithm can estimate the appropriate insulin dose. I design Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms for this control problem. The figure below represents the main components of an Artificial Pancreas System (APS) to treat T1D.

Maintaining glucose levels is a life-long optimisation problem, complicated due to the disturbances associated with daily events (meals, exercise, stress.. etc), delays present in glucose sensing and insulin action, partial observability, and safety constraints among others. Below you can see a simulated glucose control strategy of a RL algorithm.

<!-- I completed my BSc (Hons) in Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, and a product of Ananda College, Colombo 10. I have diverse interest areas in research such as AI, Machine Learning, Biomedical Signal Processing, Financial Analytics and Data Science. I'm a CIMA passed finalist, and have been able to successfully combine my engineering and accounting knowledge to work on develop algorithms focusing on financial predictions and fraud analytics. 

I believe that there is great potential to apply AI towards healthcare which undoubtedly will add great value. My passion in this domain lead towards working on projects related to Biomedical Engineering and Machine Learning. I have worked on disease prediction applications focusing on the Photoplethysmography (PPG) signals of users and injury prediction applications using Electromyography (EMG) signals and IMU data. Detailed descriptions and findings of the projects can be accessed through the Portfolio section.  -->

<!-- My philosophy is to keep everything simple, and I love to read, write and play the guitar, Chess during my leisure time. My thoughts are expressed in the form of a Blog which can be accessed through the Thoughts section. My passion is to work on novel research areas, where my ultimate goal is to combine my Engineering & Entrepreneurial skills to ensure great value addition to the society. -->
