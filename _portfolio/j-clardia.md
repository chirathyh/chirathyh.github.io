Clardia is a Comprehensive Family Health Assistant which can extract health parameters such as the Weight, Body Fat, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen Levels, Temperature and the PPG Signal of the user. Each family member is just required to stand on top of the Clardia device for 20 seconds. The obtained parameters are thus analyzed to identify diseases symptoms in advance and identify the possibility of potential diseases.

We identified that the focus on family healthcare is really minimal due to the busy lifestyles, and the lack of motivation, and the inability to identify minute disease symptoms invisible to the naked eye at an early stage. Thus we started developing Clardia as a solution.

Each family member is just required to stand on top of the Clardia device for 20 seconds. The obtained parameters are thus analyzed to identify diseases symptoms in advance and identify the possibility of potential diseases.

The device is connected to the home wifi connection and thus the extracted health parameters would be communicated and stored automatically. The analyzed information could be viewed via the Clardia Application. Some of our major achievements are as follows,

The innovation of Clardia lies within the identification of an important need of focusing on “family healthcare”. To achieve this objective it has been designed in a novel manner by integrating technologies together and creating “a single device” to obtain the aforementioned range of key health parameters. The design is user friendly has within the span of just 20 seconds the device can extract the parameters without any user intervention. The health analytics provided by the device adds immense value to the consumer to identify the potential diseases in advance and obtain preventive action towards health. In order to develop the product the application of the PPG (Photoplethysmography ) technology to the human sole was researched upon and key relationships identified and developed to produce the device with great user experience.
